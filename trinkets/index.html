            <p>Front-end for Emmie's <a href="https://gist.github.com/ehe-odoo/e9e4d256050a9dcea5fc68864c4a80d4">lunch_split.py</a>. Has an "order" mode which generates URL for individual orders, and a pay mode when someone visits that URL. All info is encoded as query parameters, so this can run completely on the client-side. One possible caveat is when the parameters exceed the character limit for GET requests which isn't handled, but it's not the end of the world.</p>
