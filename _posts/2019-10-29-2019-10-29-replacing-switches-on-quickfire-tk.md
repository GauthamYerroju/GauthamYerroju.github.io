## Replacing switches on Quickfire TK

r/MechanicalKeyboards tends to suck you in and eat yoru time and wallet. I wanted to dive into building my own keyboards from the many kits available online. The major barrier though, was soldering, and I needed a practice project to get me started. So I purchased a soldering kit decided to replace my old Cherry MX Brown key switches on my trusty Cooler Master Quickfire TK keyboard with Aliaz 60g switches (which are silent tactile switches). This post describes the process.
