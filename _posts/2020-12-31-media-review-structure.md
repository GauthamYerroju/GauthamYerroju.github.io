I want to record my thoughts and opinions on anime/TV Shows/movies I've watched, and this is a checklist of what I'll be describing in each post.

## Aspects

Describe it using these:
- Genres/World setting
- Themes/Plot
- Tone (quirky/funny/dramatic/tragic/sarcastic)
- Pacing (per-episode pacing, overall pacing)
- Aesthetic/Animation/Effects quality
- Soundtrack consistency (jarring and inconsistent/forgettable but serviceable/good/exellent)
- Intelligent? (Is the plot tight and logical or is it swiss cheese?/Are smart characters smart?)
- Dramatic? (Unnecessarily dramatic/occasionally dramatic/rarely dramatic)
- Trope check:
  - Fan service?
  - Power of friendship?
  - Using guilt and self-pity in excess to fabricate emotional depth?
  - And maybe a slew of other things I notice.
- TLDR

## Backlog

These are fresh in memory:

### Magi

TLDR: Surprisingly good. Animation seems bad in thebeginning but has great themes, decent world building and interesting chracters.

### Attack on Titan

TLDR: Fucking masterpiece. Intelligent _and_ dramatic (rare!), excellent animation and soundtrack, great themes and world-building, comfortable but dynamic pacing.

### Psycho-Pass

TLDR: Really good. Very intelligent, rarely dramatic but well-done (subtle), passable soundtrack, good word-building. Per-episode pacing is great (starts off as self-contained episodes but evolves into a continuous plot), but overall pacing is too fast for the word-building to really sink in, which is a shame because it's actually very good.

I'll fill these out more in the future and tweak the assessment criteria as I go along. I can probably use many of the same criteria for story-rich games too.

Thanks for reading.
