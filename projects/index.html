            <p>Front-end for Emmie's <a href="https://gist.github.com/ehe-odoo/e9e4d256050a9dcea5fc68864c4a80d4">lunch_split.py</a>. Defaults to "order" mode which can generate a URL for each new order, and a "pay" mode when someone visits that URL. All info is encoded in the URL, so this can run completely on the client-side. But what happens if the GET character limit is exceeded? It's not handled but it's hardly the end of the world.</p>
